# leaflet_challenge


## PART 1

I completed part 1 of this challenge. I mapped the earthquakes in the past 30 days with a magnitude greater than 2.5. I used this link    `http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php` to find that data in GeoJSON format. 

I used leaflet to map the locations of all the earthquakes. Different colors were used to show the earthquake depth in various ranges. 

Lastly, the style CSS file was updated to edit the legend display.

The earthquake map can be found in GitHub pages: https://afermanich87.github.io/leaflet_challenge/
